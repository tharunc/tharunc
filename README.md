## Who am I ?

This is Tharun, and I am an Undergraduate pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science. I am an ardent learner of Languages and frameworks like Java and Flutter.
Being an Engineer by day and a Writer at Night, I flounder flawlessly towards Perfection. You can check out some of my purest works at https://cipherschools.com/blogs.

I am a 2023 graduate of Panimalar Engineering College with a core in Computer Science Engineering. My academic background have embraced the importance of applying classical strategies towards modern - day applications. With a spirit in Software amalgamated with an ardour in Computer Hardware, my rapture for Computers have always been significantly substantial. A sheer sense of diligence towards Flutter and Machine Learning will be a zest which is to be inclined on.
